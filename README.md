# CodeMark (code-snippet-collector)

## Description

This plugin was created as I have to go through 40+ GO microservices for which code was not built, which was adding extra time to do the analysis and documentation part. This is created for easing the document creation process by removing the file creation and copy snippet part, which saves a lot of time for developers.

CodeMark helps you collect and store code snippets from any file in your workspace, along with their relative paths, descriptions, and explanations. It streamlines the process of documenting code, making it easy to generate markdown documentation with just a few clicks.
